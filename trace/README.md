# OpenInference Tracing

The OpenInference Tracing specification is edited in markdown files found in the [spec directory](./spec/README.md).

OpenInference Tracing is a specification for capturing and storing LLM application executions. It's designed to provide insight into the invocation of LLMs and the surrounding application context such as retrieval from vector stores and the usage of external tools such as search engines or APIs. The specification is transport and file-format agnostic, and is intended to be used in conjunction with other specifications such as JSON, ProtoBuf, and DataFrames.
